## This is a summary of the data we need: ##


### AER STANDARD: ###

    simulation parameters:
        car speed
        air density at the track
        ride heights min and max (front and rear)
        drag arm height min and max (?)

    aero parame:
        front and rear downforce


### AER ADVANCED: ###

    simulation parameters:
        air density at the track
        car frontal area
        ride heights min and max (front and rear)
        drag arm height min and max (?)

    offset parameters:
        speed threshold 
        velocity offset reference
        cz
        BALANCE_Z (?)
        CX body/front/rear

    aero and dynamics parameters (body/front/rear and angles):
        yaw
        pitch
        roll 
        steering angle 
        front and rear ride height 
        wind effect (anlge and speed)
